Head-Gordon have performed spin-unrestricted DFT calculations for all molecules,
including the closed-shell ones, while we performed spin-restricted DFT for 
closed-shell molecules. Could this have affected the results?

To check, we use spin-unrestricted DFT for some of the worst closed-shell molecules:
    - He
    - Ne
    - NaCl
    - NaCN
    - LiCl
    - LiCN
